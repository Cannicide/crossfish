# crossfish

The ultimate, all-in-one Discord bot creation suite.

> **This tool is currently under construction and WILL NOT work.**
> **Installing WILL cause errors.**

This tool, once complete, will support the following fully-featured systems:
- Command handler built on top of Discord.js, based on my existing djs-vidar library
- Event handler and simple message component event management built on top of Discord.js
- Database manager
- Economy system
- Extensible game system
- Useful utilities
- An easy-to-use CLI to instantly generate boilerplate starting bot code using crossfish, with customizations
- (Potential) integrations system with Trello, Minecraft, or more

And all of these systems will be fully written in Typescript, making IDE autocompletion and error detection stronger than in any of my previous node libraries.
